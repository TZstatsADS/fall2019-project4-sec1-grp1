+ Project summary: The goal of this project is to evaluate different recommendation approaches. We implemented Matrix Factorization nonprobabilistic algorithm with SGD approach and postprocessing KNN, and three regularizations: penalty magnitudes, bias and intercepts and temporal dymanics. And we applied MovieLens datasets (http://movielens.org). For evaluation part, we compared the performance for these different algorithms by RMSE for Movie dataset.

+ The report is formed by the Jupyter Notebook in `.ipynb` file: [main.ipynb](doc/main.ipynb).

+ The functions used in the whole report can be find [here](lib/Matrix_Factorization_A1.py).
